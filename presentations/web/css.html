CSS is presentation: it is a web page's skin

CSS in a web page has no required elements, and you should think of it like a sheet of rules

CSS can be added to a web page either internally or externally, like an email attachment

The internet has been built on the idea that structure (HTML) and style (CSS) should be separate to improve the clarity of the web

Keeping with this design, we add CSS externally through the use of the link element in the head

CSS is only allowed in the head element, and this is because browsers always build the web page in order from top to bottom

If the CSS is last, you will see the bones of a website first before you see the skin, and this is not pleasant

CSS rules are composed of 3 things: a selector, curly braces, and a set of property:value; pairs

A CSS selector tells us which HTML elements the following rule should apply to

A CSS selector can be a tag, id, class, or a combination of all 3

Curly braces are like the HTML element opening and closing tags: they say when the rule starts and stops

Propety:value; pairs are actually three parts

The name of the style property

The value of the style property

And a semicolon to indicate the end of that pair

If you forget even 1 semicolon or curly brace, the CSS will not work

CSS is named cascading for several reasons, but primarily because rules cascade or flow down from parent elements to children elements

Elements that are contained are children

Elements that are containers are parents

An element can be both a parent and a child at the same time

So if a child does not have a CSS rule for something, it will often ask its parent for that rule

The further down the sheet a rule is, the more important it is

The more specificly targeted a rule is, the more important it is

For example: two rules apply to the same HTML element and they both change the same properties
