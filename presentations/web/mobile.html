Flexibility is the key to accessible information

Think about the space available to a website

Our devices have fixed size screens and here the space is limited

User interface design gives us scroll bars and with these space is unlimited

However, on the web we begin at a middle ground

We stay within the horizontal space of the screen and expand vertically

More uncommonly, we stay within the vertical space of the screen and expand horizontally

And rarely, we expand in both directions

Any of these experiences is quite unlike any printed material

We still begin with a grid, but the difference is crucial: a web grid must be flexible where a print grid is predefined

Grids are arguably the most important aspect of design, and no where is this more true than on the web

A book cares nothing for different sizes and the reader must adapt to it

But a website, it adapts to be accessible to the user, whether viewed on a desktop or phone

However, checking for mobile, desktop, or browser is fools-gold

Technology changes so quickly that any device or browser could suddenly change support for a feature

Checking for feature support is much more stable

To create stable grids for all devices, use CSS @media queries

A @media query defines set of rules that will take effect during a page state

A @media query takes the form of “@media state1 and state2 and...”

Each @media query state is a phrase such as “screen” or “print”

But how do we detect desktop vs mobile without detecting the device itself?

Desktop devices have large screen sizes, between 768px and 1600px width

Tablet devices have medium screen sizes, up to 768px width in portrait mode

Phones have small screen sizes, up to 480px maximum width in landscape mode

A @media query can detect screen sizes using the state phrases “min-” and “max-”

The min- states takes the form of “min-dimension(size)”

The max- states takes the form of “max-dimension(size)”

For example, to detect a phone use: @media max-width(480px)

For example, to detect a tablet use: @media max-width(767px)

For example, to detect a small desktop use: @media min-width(768px) and max-width(979px)

For example, to detect a large desktop use: @media min-width(1200px)

With these @media queries, we can define new css rules for each screen size

Remember, small screen sizes are much more friendly to larger sizes and vertical layouts!

For phones and small tablets, consider changing the page into a simple vertical stack with 20 px font-size

To change a row/column grid into a vertical stack:
1. Set columns float properties to none
2. Set columns display to block
3. Set columns width to auto or 100%
4. Set row & column margins to 0

In the case that a page must retain the grid, use a fluid grid with % widths instead of px widths for universal support across screen sizes
