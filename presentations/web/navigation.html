Think of the Internet as a spider web large enough to engulf the world

It catches information, billions upon billions of ideas

And it is home to millions of spiders

We spiders, you and I, live for this information

We traverse the web through the links

These links are the anchors that give the web structure, and hold information in place

Without these anchors, the internet would be like space: a cloud of unreachable stars

And in space, no one can hear you scream

Navigation is the web

Think of the Internet as a spider web large enough to engulf the world

It catches information, billions upon billions of ideas

And it is home to millions of spiders

We spiders, you and I, live for this information

We traverse the web through the links

These links are the anchors that give the web structure, and hold information in place

Without these anchors, the internet would be like space: a cloud of unreachable stars

And in space, no one can hear you scream

We use the anchor element to create a link to other information

We set the link text just like we set paragraph text: placed between the opening and closing tags

We set the destination of the link using the href attribute

Sometimes the information is in the same page, we call this an in-page link

To create an in-page link, set the href to # and the id of the element

But usually, anchors take us to information on another page

There are absolute links, which tell us where to go from anywhere to get to there

When you send a friend a link, it is absolute

To make an absolute link, set the href to http://www.there.com/

There are relative links, which tell us where to go from here to get to there

When you go from one page in a website to another, it is relative

To make a relative link, do not include http://www.here.com/

Anchors are the simplest interactive HTML element

Click or tap, and they move you across the web

For a simple interaction we have a simple rule: always give a user feedback when they interact

For anchors, there are three notable interactions, also known as states

We can access these states through CSS pseudo-class selectors

Pseudo-classes are special built in classes made to select certain elements from a group and they always come right after the tag or class selector

The primary state is :hover, and it is triggered whenever a mouse moves over an element

The :hover state is valid for all elements!

Another state is :active, and it is triggered when a link is activated

The last is :visited, and it is triggered once a link has been used

By default, anchors are underlined to separate them from non-interactive text, but this can be changed with the text-decoration property

Creating a navigation bar is essential and simple

Begin with a <nav> element

And end with one anchor element per link

The position property defines how an element is positioned, common values are relative, fixed, and absolute

By default the position property of all elements is set to static, which creates a continuous vertical flow

Position: relative is similar to static, but it will move an element relative to its static position based on its top, bottom, left, and right properties

Example of position: relative

Position: absolute will take an element out of the vertical flow and position it relative to the top of its parent based on its top, bottom, left, & right properties

Example position: absolute

Position: fixed will take an element out of the vertical flow and position it relative to a user’s browser window based on its top, bottom, left, and right properties

Use fixed positioning to create “sticky” elements, or elements that always stay in view, such as a navigation bar

When using sticky elements, improve the contrast by using the box-shadow property to give the element a drop shadow

It is also common practice for a web page to have a footer

Web footers usually contain copyrights, notices, sponsors, and site maps

A site map is a listing of all the pages within a website, organized into lists of anchors

Site maps are great for making page navigation simple, but the trade-off is that they often take up a lot of space

When using multiple anchors in the same area, add a list element to contain the anchors for better styling and semantics
