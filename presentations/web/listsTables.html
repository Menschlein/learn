Lists & Tables are high-level organizational elements

A high-level element combines several simple or low-level elements to create a complex result

For example, a list is a container with a collection of information points, and a table a container with lots of sub-containers

You could create a list or table using lots of div and paragraph elements

Instead, HTML provides us with semantic elements for both

To create a list, we use either a ordered or unordered list

The ordered list is denoted by <ol>, and is used for sequential information

The unordered list is denoted by <ul>, and is used for general information

The <ul> is used most commonly and works very well for navigation

List items are denoted by <li>, and can contain multiple elements that relate to a single point of information

The <ul>’s list-style-type property defines the appearance of a bullet point, common values are circle, square, and none

The <ul>’s list-style-position property defines where the bullet point will appear, common values are outside and inside

By default, lists display vertically

To create a horizontal list, set the <li>’s display property to inline or inline-block

To control the spacing between list items, change the <li>’s padding or margin properties

Sometimes, our data is tabular, and for that we use a <table> element

For a long time, designers used tables across an entire website because they provided easy organization

This is now considered bad practice

HTML tables are organized by row, then by column

A table row is denoted by <tr>, and contains only column cells

A table cell is denoted by <td>, and contains information, by default cells are left aligned

A table body is denoted by <tbody> and contains all table content

A table header is denoted by <thead> and is used for column labels

Table cells inside the header are denoted by <th> and are by default center aligned and bold

Table cells can span multiple rows with the rowspan attribute

Table cells can span multiple columns with the colspan attribute

By default, tables are surrounded and sliced by borders

The border property affects all elements in a table and is on by default

The border-width property defines the size of the border

The border-style property defines the appearance of the border, common values are solid, dashed, & none

The border-color property defines the color of the border, set in hex, rgb, & rgba

The border property is a combination of border-width, border-style, & border-color

By default the border property affects all 4 sides

To set a border for a specific side, add -top, -bottom, -left, or -right after the word border in the property name

The <table>'s border-collapse property defines whether or not double borders in a table can merge into one

Most table styling should be added to the table cells

A special property of table cells is that they allow vertical alignment of content across a row

Empty table cells can create gaps in tables, to fix this use the special word “&nbzp;”

To avoid confusion in large tables, use the nth-child pseudo-selector to add alternating background colors

The background-color property defines the fill color of an element, common values are hex, rgb, rgba, and gradients

To select every even list item, use li:nth-child(even)

For our even rows, let's set the background-color to a simple hex #dddddd

To select every odd list item, use li:nth-child(odd)

For our odd rows, we’ll leave them as the default background-color

You can also use the :hover pseudo-selector to give a user feedback as they browse the table

When we hover, let's set the background-color to #bbbbbb
