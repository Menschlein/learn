HTML = structure: it is a web page's skeleton

HTML in a web page requires 5 basic things: doctype, html, head, title, and body

Each thing in a web page is a HTML element

Each HTML element is a certain type of element, or tag

A tag is a like a blueprint for a type of house

A HTML element is one of the houses built using that blueprint

Each HTML element is a container

Some HTML elements contain only text, while others contain other elements

Each HTML element is composed of 1 opening tag and 1 closing tag (there are a few exceptions)

An opening tag is like saying two things:
Start a new element here
Use this blueprint
this element will contain everything after this point

Then you may add as many other elements as you like (each with their own opening and closing tags)

And then never forget the closing tag, which is like saying:
This element is complete
Stop using this blueprint
Stop containing any more elements

Remember our required HTML elements? Each has a special function

The doctype tells our browser what language it should use to speak to the web page

The html element, not to be confused with HTML, is the container for the web page

The head element is inside the html element and is the container for all the invisible identifying information

The title element is inside the head and is the web pageâ€™s name

The body element is is inside the html element and is the container or everything we see on a web page

To use a human as an example, the html element is the whole human, the head element is their identity, the title element their name, the body element their body, and the doctype element the name of their language and culture

There are also 3 essential HTML tags: paragraph, header, and division

Paragraph is denoted by p, and is a container designed for basic text

Headers are denoted by h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6, and are containers designed for important text

Division is denoted by div and is the most useful of all elements: it is a container for anything

For example: a very basic web page with all 8 previously mentioned tags
