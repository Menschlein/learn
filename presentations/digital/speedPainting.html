Speed Painting is all about layering

When we speed paint, we arenâ€™t necessarily using actual digital layers

Although you might separate the base colors from the shadows from the highlights

We are layering areas of color over and over and over

And we do it as quickly as we can

Weâ€™re not looking for picture perfect

If anything, speed painting is much closer to Impressionism than Photography

Speed painting has four general steps

Start with evaluation: see what you have and pick the least refined area of your painting

Evaluation, examining what youâ€™ve got and planning your next move

Follow evaluation with Zooming: make the spot you picked your canvas and forget the rest

Zooming, focusing into or away from a point of interest to create a temporary new canvas

Once zoomed, let your brushes and colors shift: smaller as you zoom in and larger as you zoom out

Shapeshifting, changing your brush and color to match your needs

Consider changing brush radius, or the size of the brush

Consider changing brush hardness, or the level of hard or soft edge on a brush

Consider changing brush opacity, or the transparency of the brush stroke

With shifted brushes, block your best guess: drop color areas like a boss

Blocking, placing areas of color to create a general idea of the final product

Finally, re-evaluate and repeat

Always paint on a very large canvas, around 3000 px in any direction at 300 ppi

A larger canvas gives a higher range of zoom and much finer control

On a canvas of 800 x 800 px, you can zoom once before the pixel wall hits

On a canvas of 3000 x 3000 px, you can zoom between 3 to 5 times before you reach the pixel wall

The pixel wall is the point at which you cannot get any more detailed

A digital speed painting should take between 30 minutes to 4 hours

Speed painting is meant be fast, it is a gestural process
