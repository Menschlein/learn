Vector graphics are mathematical equations

Not to worry, youâ€™ll never have to do one bit of math!

But unlike raster graphics, math allows vector graphics to scale perfectly

Scaling is the act of changing an objectâ€™s size without changing the object itself

Think of it in terms of a balloon:

If you blow twice as much air in, it's still the same balloon only two times bigger

If you take half of the air out, it's still the same balloon only half as big

Vector graphics work just like the balloon, and their strength lies in their scalability

In fact, we use vector graphics far more than raster graphics

Logos are vector graphics

User interfaces are vector graphics

Most importantly, Text is vector graphics

Everyone has resized text at some time, and it is always crisp

But then when we try to make an image bigger it looks horrible and jagged

This is because one is vector and the other raster

A Raster graphic is a collection of millions pixels, each with its own color

Compared to millions of bits of color, A Vector graphic is exceedingly simple

It is a collection of points with a fill and a stroke

A point is a 2D location on the screen, sometimes called an anchor

This is like a pixelâ€™s location, but not locked to a grid

Rarely does a vector graphic have more than a few hundred points

Each point is connected to the next by a line, and all together these form a shape

Each point may also have controls, one for each of its lines

A control is like a line magnet, it pulls the line towards itself

A fill is the color or gradient that fills the shape made by the points (it can be invisible)

A stroke is the color and thickness of the line that forms the shape (it can be invisible)

Compared to raster graphics, Vector graphics are almost always visually simpler

Compared to raster graphics, Vector graphics almost always have a smaller file size

So when you need something to look right no matter where or how it's seen, use vector graphics
