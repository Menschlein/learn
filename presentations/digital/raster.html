<!--
raster graphics are grid-based data structures

we know these as images

but not all images are Raster

raster graphics are one half of the duo that includes vector graphics

raster graphics excell at complex imagery

such as photographs or paintings

while vector graphics excell at geometry

such as typography and icons

remember the part about the grid?

raster is all about rectangular grids

in-fact, raster images have to be rectangular

with a resolution of width x height

we could say it is a matrix

where columns = width and rows = height

and each element is a pixel

this gives us super-fine control of our image

but it makes the file size very large

because we need to keep track of every pixel

each of which may have

R, G, B, and sometimes A

this is also known as a bitmap

and we can't scale a raster image up

(without losing quality)

have you ever watched a crime show?

ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM!

this is impossible

no technology could or will ever do this

because all we have in a raster image

is the grid of pixels

there are no hidden pixels waiting to be discovered

so yes, we can scale a raster image up

but this just makes new (fake) pixels

with color based on the pixels nearby

and results in pixelation

speaking of pixels

raster images also contain a pixel density

otherwise known as pixels per inch or ppi

sometimes people call this dpi, or dots per inch

this is not always correct

dpi refers to the physical density of dots of the image when printed

ppi refers to intended size of the image when printed

so an image of 1000 x 1000 pixels

or 1 megapixel

with a ppi of 100

would print at 10 x 10 inches

remember, ppi doesn't affect the pixels themselves

because a digital image has no inherent physical dimensions

we manipulate raster graphics with software such as

paint, photoshop, and GIMP

which give us many smart tools to edit anywhere from

an individual pixel to a group of pixels

and let us save our work in common formats such as

GIF for pixel art

PNG for transparency

JPG for photos

TIFF, PSD, XCF for layers

whether you use raster or vector

in the end what we see on screen is always a rasterized interpretation
