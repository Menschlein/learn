<!--
pixels are the basic building blocks of digital images

they are the smallest controllable element on the screen

the word pixel

is made of pix for pictures

and el for element

roughly: an element in a picture

pixels do not need to be seen as square (circle, line)

this is called rendering

when we take a set of color data

and convert it into an image

the point being

a pixel is a set of numbers that make a color

such as RGB, RGBA, CMYK, etc

and

a pixel is a visual element

in a raster image or bitmap

pixel art is the process of creating images

by working at the pixel level

like drawing one dot at a time

or making a mosaic

most video and mobile phone games use pixel art

mario is a great example

the difficulty of pixel art

is using limited space and color

to communicate precisely

i.e. blurring is not cool

pixel art starts with either

line art, where lines are laid out

or blocking, where color areas are laid out

and then refining (a lot)

because of limited colors

dithering, or noise, is used to blend

pixel art usually comes in two varieties

isometric and non-isometric

isometric pixel art

comes from isometric projection

where the angle between two perspective lines is 120 degrees

or a single line is at a 30 degree angle

and while it gives the impression of 3D space, it has no perspective

isometric pixel art is at an angle of about 22.5 degrees

with diagonal lines at a 1:2 vertical:horizontal ratio

because an angle of 30 degrees would not follow a neat pattern

non-isometric is simply from a 2D perspective

unlike most raster graphic images

pixel art scales decently

as long as you use nearest-neighbor

instead of the usual bilinear or bicubic settings

this is because nearest-neighbor preserves hard edges

speaking of hard edges

remember to always save pixel art

in a lossless format such as GIF or PNG

and avoid lossy formats such as JPG

or all that hard work will be messy and blurred
