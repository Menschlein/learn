Ex: 192.168.0.1\n\nThis is called the IPv4 system, and it allows for around 4 billion unique IP addresses\n\n4 billion is not nearly enough these days, so we're moving to the IPv6 system, where an IP address is much more complex: 2001:cdba:0000:5768:0000:0000:ffdf:9889\n\nBut the browser doesn't do the conversion itself, it sends the URL to a DNS server, which sends back the IP address\n\nUsing the IP address, the browser can send a request for a web page to the device on the other end\n\nThis device is usually a server, and it hosts or carries the website’s files\n\nHere we need to separate server-side and client-side\n\nServer-side scripting is when the server finds and modifies part or all of the web page and sends the results to your browser\n\nServer-side scripting is required when information security is a concern\n\nClient-side scripting is when your browser uses what the server sent it to build the final web page for you to use\n\nClient-side scripting is where layout, styling, and interactivity happens\n\nLayout comes from HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language\n\nStyling comes from CSS, or Cascading Style Sheet\n\nInteractivity comes from JS, or JavaScript\n\nThese are your 3 client-side languages\n\nIf you know these languages, you are a web designer\n\nBut you are also a front-end web developer\n\nA web designer is someone that can create layouts and styles\n\nA web developer can be someone who does programming on either the server or client sides\n\nSo to differentiate, we say that server-side developers are back-end developers and client-side developers are front-end developers\n\nThey use the complex back-end data to build accessible, user friendly, and interactive websites\n\nExamples: Facebook, YouTube\n\nThink of these three languages together as a human\n\nHTML is the bones\n\nIt makes sure our bodies are supported so we aren’t a big blobby mess\n\nHTML is required\n\nCSS is the skin, hair, eyes, clothes, and makeup\n\nIt makes sure we’re looking fine and appeal to our target audience\n\nCSS is not required, but without it you only have a skeleton\n\nJS is the muscles, nerves, organ, and brain\n\nWithout it we can't think or act, we’re just a pretty statue\n\nJS is not required, but without it you have no life (this may be a little dramatic)\n\n\n-->"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2810}]],"length":2810}
