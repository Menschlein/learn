and the id of the element\n\nBut usually, anchors take us to information on another page\n\nThere are absolute links, which tell us where to go from anywhere to get to there\n\nWhen you send a friend a link, it is absolute\n\nTo make an absolute link, set the href to http://www.there.com/\n\nThere are relative links, which tell us where to go from here to get to there\n\nWhen you go from one page in a website to another, it is relative\n\nTo make a relative link, do not include http://www.here.com/\n\nAnchors are the simplest interactive HTML element\n\nClick or tap, and they move you across the web\n\nFor a simple interaction we have a simple rule: always give a user feedback when they interact\n\nFor anchors, there are three notable interactions, also known as states\n\nWe can access these states through CSS pseudo-class selectors\n\nPseudo-classes are special built in classes made to select certain elements from a group and they always come right after the tag or class selector\n\nThe primary state is :hover, and it is triggered whenever a mouse moves over an element\n\nThe :hover state is valid for all elements!\n\nAnother state is :active, and it is triggered when a link is activated\n\nThe last is :visited, and it is triggered once a link has been used\n\nBy default, anchors are underlined to separate them from non-interactive text, but this can be changed with the text-decoration property\n\nCreating a navigation bar is essential and simple\n\nBegin with a <nav> element\n\nAnd end with one anchor element per link\n\nThe position property defines how an element is positioned, common values are relative, fixed, and absolute\n\nBy default the position property of all elements is set to static, which creates a continuous vertical flow\n\nPosition: relative is similar to static, but it will move an element relative to its static position based on its top, bottom, left, and right properties\n\nExample of position: relative\n\nPosition: absolute will take an element out of the vertical flow and position it relative to the top of its parent based on its top, bottom, left, & right properties\n\nExample position: absolute\n\nPosition: fixed will take an element out of the vertical flow and position it relative to a user’s browser window based on its top, bottom, left, and right properties\n\nUse fixed positioning to create “sticky” elements, or elements that always stay in view, such as a navigation bar\n\nWhen using sticky elements, improve the contrast by using the box-shadow property to give the element a drop shadow\n\nIt is also common practice for a web page to have a footer\n\nWeb footers usually contain copyrights, notices, sponsors, and site maps\n\nA site map is a listing of all the pages within a website, organized into lists of anchors\n\nSite maps are great for making page navigation simple, but the trade-off is that they often take up a lot of space\n\nWhen using multiple anchors in the same area, add a list element to contain the anchors for better styling and semantics\n\n-->"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":6270}]],"length":6270}
