Each has a special function\n\nThe doctype tells our browser what language it should use to speak to the web page\n\nThe html element, not to be confused with HTML, is the container for the web page\n\nThe head element is inside the html element and is the container for all the invisible identifying information\n\nThe title element is inside the head and is the web pageâ€™s name\n\nThe body element is is inside the html element and is the container or everything we see on a web page\n\nTo use a human as an example, the html element is the whole human, the head element is their identity, the title element their name, the body element their body, and the doctype element the name of their language and culture\n\nThere are also 3 essential HTML tags: paragraph, header, and division\n\nParagraph is denoted by p, and is a container designed for basic text\n\nHeaders are denoted by h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6, and are containers designed for important text\n\nDivision is denoted by div and is the most useful of all elements: it is a container for anything\n\nFor example: a very basic web page with all 8 previously mentioned tags\n\n-->"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2096}]],"length":2096}
